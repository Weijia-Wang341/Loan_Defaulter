# Loan Defaulter
This project focuses on analyzing features and risk flags associated with business loans. We aim to build statistical models and apply machine learning techniques to address the imbalance issues in the dataset, ultimately achieving higher accuracy scores and AUC values as measured by a confusion matrix. Additionally, the developed model can help predict future loan defaulters based on the analyzed features.
